# Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining - Homework 4
# *Hard coding*
**Goal of the homework**: write important algorithms and function from scratch.

Made by Group #6, also known as: *Sabriye Ela Esme, Octavianus Surya Putra 
Sinaga*, and *Flaminia Spasiano*.

This repository contais:
* `hashing_lib.py`: a python module that contains all the hash functions we've used to build the bloom filter.
* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook explaines choices we've made throughout the homework. 


## 1. Hashing task!
For this task we've built three hash functions, necessary to implement the Bloom Filter. 

In the `hashing_lib.py` are contained our hash functions: 
1. One is a particular implementation of an hash function based on Fibonacci hashing method.
2. For another one, we took inspiration form a famous hash function (SHA256), which is very fast and it's often used in cryptographic protocols.
3. The last one takes advantage of the particular construction of each password.

To implement our Bloom Filter structure we've dediced to..... to be continued
